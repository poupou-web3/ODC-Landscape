##  What is Sybil Attacks and why we should fight it?

**V0.0 @stefi:**

The name Sybil originated from a medical case of a woman called Sybil, she was diagnosed  with multiple personality disorder. 
Sybil attack is a kind of "fraud" that occurs on systems/organizations where actions and rewards are calculated based on "one human, one identity", fraudsters or 'sybils' create multiple identities in an attempt to control (vote) or profit ( distributions of funds or rewards).
Fighting this kind of practice enables organizations to have democratic practices without the physical presence of its participants , for example online voting in DAOs.

**V0.1 @poupou:**

A Sybil attack refers to a type of attack in which an attacker creates multiple fake identities, or "Sybils” to gain an unfair advantage within a decentralized network. This term is a reference to a [book entitled Sybil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_(Schreiber_book)). This book was also made into two television movies, the main character Sybil Dorsett endorsed different personalities.

In the context of systems/organizations Sybils attacks happens when actions or rewards are calculated based on “one human, one identity”.
Fraudsters or 'sybils' create multiple identities in an attempt to control (vote) or profit ( distributions of funds or rewards).
Fighting this kind of practice enables organizations to have democratic practices without the physical presence of its participants , for example online voting in DAOs.

## What is quadratic funding and matching? Why is it important to understand Sybil attacks?  
**V0.0 @stefi:**
Image is better than a thousand words,right? Check this 60 sec video by Gitcoin and come back here:

Nice, now that you understood, is easy to get why fraudster create multiple accounts. The idea is simple, make really small contributions to their own project from different accounts in a attempt to maximize ROI, as quadratic funding algorithm prioritize distribution of matching funds pool to projects that received donations from the biggest number of community members. 

**V0.1 @poupou:**
Quadratic funding is a mechanism used by Gitcoin to fund public goods. Contributions to a grant are matched in a quadratic way by a matching fund.

Similarly, quadratic mechanism can also be applied to voting (quadratic voting) where each voter vote with its amount of tokens, then fraudsters are incentivized to vote for a proposal from many addresses rather than a single address.


## What is price of forgery? 
**V0.0 @stefi:**
Price (or cost) of forgery, as it says, is the cost paid to forge an identity in a system. There are a lot of discussions about economic games involved in sybil defense. Most systems are designed to develop a high cost of forgery in an attempt to disincentivize sybils attacks, making the attack expensive and not profitable. Some discussion argue that this could stop sybil attacks focused on profit but if the motivation is other, like ideological, cost could be not a barrier.  

In ep 36 of Green Pill podcast, Kevin Owocki and Petr Porobov, founder of Upala, have some discussion around the topic and how Upala is trying to understand the real price of forgery using incentives.
